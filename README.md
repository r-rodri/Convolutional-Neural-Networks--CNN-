This work comprises the application and analysis of three models of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), LeNet, AlexNet and DenseNet of a set of data that contains images of bees.
The models were implemented in python and their performance was compared in classifying each of the images in the database in terms of 'loss', 'accuracy' and the time required to train the models.
In the models created, different parameters were used to explore their influence on the results, such as the number of epochs, the activation function, the 'batch size', the 'kernel' and 'dropout'.
